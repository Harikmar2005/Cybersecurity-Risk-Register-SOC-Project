# Cybersecurity-Risk-Register-SOC-Project


## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **Cybersecurity Risk Register** developed for a **simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment**.  
The purpose of this project is to **identify, assess, prioritize, and manage cybersecurity risks** that could impact an organization’s information systems, networks, and data.


---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify cybersecurity risks across IT infrastructure and SOC operations
- Analyze risks based on **likelihood** and **impact**
- Assign **risk ratings** to prioritize mitigation efforts
- Define **controls and mitigation strategies**
- Track **risk ownership and status**

---

## 🧩 Scope of the Risk Register
The risk register covers risks related to:
- Authentication and access control
- Network security
- Endpoint security
- Log monitoring and SIEM alerts
- Incident response processes
- Data protection and compliance
- Human factors (phishing, insider threats)

## 📊 Risk Assessment Methodology
Each risk is evaluated using the following criteria:

### Risk Parameters
- **Risk ID** – Unique identifier for each risk
- **Risk Description** – Detailed explanation of the risk
- **Threat Source** – Internal or external threat actor
- **Vulnerability** – Weakness being exploited
- **Likelihood** – Probability of occurrence (Low / Medium / High)
- **Impact** – Business or security impact (Low / Medium / High)
- **Risk Rating** – Calculated based on likelihood × impact
- **Existing Controls** – Current security controls in place
- **Mitigation Strategy** – Recommended actions to reduce risk
- **Risk Owner** – Responsible team or role
- **Risk Status** – Open / In Progress / Mitigated

---

## 🛡 Example Risks Included
- Brute force attacks due to weak password policies
- Phishing attacks leading to credential compromise
- Inadequate log monitoring in SIEM
- Unpatched systems vulnerable to exploitation
- Lack of incident response procedures
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel (Risk Register documentation)
- SIEM concepts (log monitoring and alerting)
- SOC workflows and investigation processes

---

## 📚 Standards & Frameworks Referenced
- ISO/IEC 27001 Risk Management principles
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify & Protect functions)


---



## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding cybersecurity risk management
- Hands-on experience with risk registers
- Ability to link risks with controls and mitigation
- SOC-focused security thinking

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured approach to **cybersecurity risk management** through the creation of a risk register for a simulated **Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment. It showcases the ability to identify security risks, assess their likelihood and impact, and define appropriate mitigation strategies. The project reflects practical understanding of SOC workflows, risk assessment principles, and industry-recognized frameworks, making it a valuable addition to a cybersecurity learning portfolio.
